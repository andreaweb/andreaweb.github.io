    <h4>Andrea here.</h4>
    <p class="description">I like to code. But I don't believe people should be defined by their profession, which is why I also like to share a bit of my world. If you don't care, you can just look at my curriculum.</p>

      <h4>Work & Education & Skills</h4>
      <p>I've worked in a small marketing company, doing a little bit of everything: 3d, video, graphic design, clients attendance, and of course, front-end. I've also worked in average-sized companies that worked for pretty big companies, and since then I've been more focused, working with front-end only, learning what was git and gulp and improving my Javascript skills.</p>
      <p>I still have a long way ahead of me (well, I guess even the seniors do!). For now, I'm focusing in mastering Javascript and its frameworks.</p>
      <p>My diploma is in Graphic Design but I study programming in places such as Free Code Camp, Codecademy, Code School, Khan Academy and Livecoding. I also read and study books such as Eloquent Javascript and the series You Don't Know JS.</p>

      <h4>Hobbies & Interests (besides Programming)</h4>
      <p>I kinda started saying that in the right, but let's go into specifics, shall we?</p>
      <p>I like slow-paced games *cough* turn-based RPGs *cough*. Although I also love Need for Speed, but being good at it, it's a whole different story. Right now I just play at my laptop or my Nintendo 3DS.</p>
      <p>I love A Song of Ice and Fire and the Kingkiller Chronicles. Recently I discovered Bernard Cornwell and I love him, possibly even more. Isaac Asimov is another <3 </p>
      <p>I also write a book that connects many of my interests. It doesn't have an official site yet but you can check the wiki.</p>
      <p>I love the mysteries of our universe and of ourselves. I can't choose between Humanities and Exacts. They need each other and they're equally interesting!</p>
