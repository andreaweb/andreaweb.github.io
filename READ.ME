My Coding Portfolio. I'll update it with new projects and skills as I go. For now, all projects listed come from FreeCodeCamp. There are more in my codepen.io, but I'm being picky for this portfolio.

As it is you don't *have to* use browser-sync, but as I add more stuff, it'll end up being mandatory.

1 - Git Clone
2 - Npm install
3 - browser-sync start --server --files "*"
