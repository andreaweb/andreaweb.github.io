My Coding Portfolio. I'll update it with new projects and skills as I go. For now, all live listed projects come from FreeCodeCamp curriculum, but I'm also solving the front-end-challenges list, and those will be available in <a href="https://github.com/andreaweb/front-end-challenges">my own repository</a>. There are more in my codepen.io, but I'm being picky for this portfolio.

As it is you don't *have to* use browser-sync, but as I add more stuff, it'll end up being mandatory.

1 - Git Clone
2 - Npm install
3 - browser-sync start --server --files "*"
