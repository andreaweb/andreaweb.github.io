## Portfolio

It displays my main public projects with their stacks. Originally it was pure HTML/CSS/JS, but a few months ago it became a React app. The source code is in the branch react-portfolio.

I'm thinking of adding Material-UI in the near future. I don't like how the projects' descriptions currently open and I believe MUI would be way easier to use and provide a better UX overall.
